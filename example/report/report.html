<h1>Development for the WEB course report</h1>

<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have worked with GitHub since the first year of my Software Development Studies.</p>
<p>I did not however work with Markdown and GitHub Pages, the latter I discovered
   and used during my first lecture of development for web and it proved to be useful.</p>
<p>I never created web sites before (only android and java apps) but I'm very interested to create them.</p>
<p>I knew that javascript is used to privide functionality for a web page, and CSS is
   used how to design the appearence of a page. An html file will arrange the components of a page
   such as headers, titles footers and php is used to establish the connection between a web page and a database</p>
<p>The closest I got to work with this elements, was in highschool, creating an html file and in HKR,
   creating CSS files for android apps</p>
<p>For this course section I learned how to execute git commands inside the git bash.</p>
<p>Previously I was using intellij's integrated GitHub commands for push, commitm, pull and so on.</p>
<p>I learned to tag my commits, a thing no one taught us before, up until this moment.</p>
<p>I learned to open an HTML file with GitHub pages.</p>
