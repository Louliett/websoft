<p>My name is Andrei Casian. I was born and raised in Moldova. It's a small
   country in Eastern part of Europe, with no future. I was always interested
   in computers programming and technology but for some reaseon I decided to
   2 years of Law in Romania and another 2 years of Law in France.
   I didn't like it. That's when I decided to try what I really was interested
   in and it worked!
   I'm in my 3rd year of Software Development and looking forward to finish it!
</p>

<p>My hobbies include reading books, listening to music (tons of it) and
   podcasts with interesting people as well as drawing.
