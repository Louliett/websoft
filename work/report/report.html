      <h2>S01</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked with GitHub since the first year of my
        Software Development Studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not however work with Markdown and GitHub Pages, the latter
        I discovered and used during my first lecture of development for web and
        it proved to be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never created web sites before (only android and java apps) but
        I'm very interested to create them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that javascript is used to privide functionality for a web page,
        and CSS is used how to design the appearence of a page. An html file
        will arrange the components of a page such as headers, titles footers
        and php is used to establish the connection between a web page and a
        database
      </p>
      <p>
        The closest I got to work with these elements, was in highschool
        creating an html file and in HKR creating CSS files for JavaFX. For this
        course section I learned how to execute git commands inside the git bash.
        Previously I was using intellij's integrated GitHub commands for push,
        commitm, pull and so on. I learned to tag my commits, a thing no one
        taught us before, up until this moment. I learned to open an HTML file
        with GitHub pages.
      </p>

      <h2>S02</h2>
      <p>
        I have worked with HTML in highschool, we built simple html documents
        where we created headers, paragraphs, and a little bit of styling.
        I worked with CSS in my first year of Software Development,
        on a JavaFX project. I didn't work with JavaScript though, I watched
        some tutorials before, out of curiosity, learning about syntax, variable
        declaration, functions but never really diving into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I understood, the HTML file, is responsable to display the components
        in the browser, for example, the browser will search for the header,
        title, icon, default language in order to display the contents correctly.
        CSS serves for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser intteracts with web servers through protocols. The most
        popular and well known is the HTTP. It's an application layer protocol.
        To access a resource, the browser most probably will use a GET command.
        HTTP runs on top of TCP meaning the communication with the server and
        transfer of data is more secure, thanks to TCP's reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to style particular parts of a HTML document such as
        paragraphs, body, headers. I learned about creating classes and use them
        for specific elements. I discovered IDs which are not recommended to use
        in large amounts and only for very unique reasons. Finally I learned to
        change the CSS file directly in the browser and see how it changes
        dynamically the web page.
      </p>

        I do not have any experience with java script on client side. Thanks to
        the coding exercise I could form an opinon about related coding languages.
        And the only language coming to mind is Java, specificaly for Android
        development. We worked for a project where we use FireBase as our database.
        This database operates with JSON files, so we had to display JSON obecjts
        in tables and other database operations, sorting, deleting.
      </p>

      <h2>S04</h2>
      <p>
        I had no experience with Node.js or npm. However, it felt very natural
        working with because it remainded me of Java's object oriented aspect.
        I learned how to structure the code more elegantly by assigning diferent
        classes and modules, each to work on a specific task instead of cramming
        all the code in a single script. This allows the code to breathe,
        be organized and be easier debbuged. I learned to create modules,
        to export them, to create clases and export them, to create views and
        using ejs and display various components.
      </p>

      <h2>S05</h2>
      <p>
        PHP feels quite repulsive, I must admit. Mostly because of syntax,
        working in editors like Atom, makes you waste time on just composing the
        script. The logic is quite the same as other languages though. I don't
        know what IDEs are there for PHP but I hope they have tools to facilitate
        the code composing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must admit though it felt quite useful on creating web pages.
        I like the fact the it accepts html in its syntax. You can therefore
        create webpages without even creating html files. I also liked the OOP
        attribute of PHP where you can have footers in one script, headers in
        another and then call them when they are needed.

      <h2>S06</h2>
      <p>The top 3 most popular programming languages in decreasing order are:
        Python, Java, Javascript. Java is holding second position to it's extreme
        popularity and spread for the last 20 years. However, Python having the
        first place is an indicator that programmers tend to a more simplified
        syntax. Python has an enormous variety of libraries, easily implementable.
        The growing interest in machine learning and neural network together with
        Python which is currently the most optimal language for these technologies,
        allows it to be on top of the most popular programming lanugages.
      </p>
      <p>Since I'm also interested in neural networks, I would choose Python as
         my next programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to reccomend a language to my potential employer, I would recommended
        something Im comfortable with which is Java. I would enummerate all the
        milestones you can achieve with this language and mention its popularity.

      <h2>S07</h2>
      <p>.NET is a platform for developing a large variety of applications. A nice feature
         is the language interoperability, meaning it can accept code from different programming languages,
          running in unison. ASP.NET is a component of .NET framework used for web development.
          C# is a object oriented programming language. It looks like a Java imitation, or how
          the author of Java stated: "C# is sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."
      </p>
      <p>
        If I thought that PHP was dull, boy was I wrong. The .NET framework is straight up painful.
        You need to study thoroughly developing for this platform. My first encouter with this framework
        was quite cold, whilst Nodejs for instance, was more apealing for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, I just wanted the grade 3 so I could get back to the website project.
        I thought I would finish fast and work on the website project but I didnt understand the task
        so I had to watch all the videos(thank you by the way for them) from the lecture 7, since
        I didn't attend it (for working on the website project).
      </p>
      <p>
        Today I learned writing code in C#, defining classes and importing, creating a simple API
        and a simple console app. It remainded me constantly of Java both the console and the web app
        with the exception that I didnt have to create web socket (thanks God).

      <h2>S08</h2>
      <p>This assignment was performed with my project groupmate.</p>
      <p>After analyzing three webpages: <a href="imgur.com">Imgur</a>, <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="youtube.com">YouTube</a>
         the results where charted on the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1PxviLsURwwJxOLEElPrND_GqIqyzvNAudw7Dh8H7c/edit#gid=0">graphs</a>.
         <br>
         Although we installed the Lighthouse extension, PageSpeed Insights is using Lighthouse lab data therefore we
         did not include Lighthouse average score.
         Judging the overall speed I was not surprised seing GitHub outrunning the other two pages. being mostly used
         by desktops, it just flies. Imgur, being a popular web platform for funny gifs and cats had quite a balanced
         speed between desktop and mobile version.
         I was surprised though seing YouTube, such a powerful and popular platform having the lowest PageSpeed score
         on both: mobile and desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opportunities for improvements for each page would be:
        <br>
        Imgur:
        <br>
        - Preload key requests (-2.91s);
        <br>
        GitHub:
        <br>
        - Serve images in next-gen formats (-0.91s);
        <br>
        - Deffer offscreen images (-0.8s);
        <br>
        YouTube:
        <br>
        - Preload key requests (-2.05s);
        <br>
        - Eliminate render-blocking resources (-1.4s)
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned today about powerful optimization tools which will definitely come in handy
        when testing our own websites. While quite new in web development and not being introduced
        so much about performance, the fact that these tools are here to help us is surely worth looking into.
