<h1>Development for the WEB course report</h1>

<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I have worked with GitHub since the first year of my Software Development Studies.</p>
<p>I did not however work with Markdown and GitHub Pages, the latter I discovered
   and used during my first lecture of development for web and it proved to be useful.</p>
<p>I never created web sites before (only android and java apps) but I'm very interested to create them.</p>
<p>I knew that javascript is used to privide functionality for a web page, and CSS is
   used how to design the appearence of a page. An html file will arrange the components of a page
   such as headers, titles footers and php is used to establish the connection between a web page and a database</p>
<p>The closest I got to work with these elements, was in highschool creating an html file and in HKR
   creating CSS files for JavaFX. For this course section I learned how to execute git
   commands inside the git bash. Previously I was using intellij's integrated GitHub commands for push,
   commitm, pull and so on. I learned to tag my commits, a thing no one taught us before, up until this moment.
   I learned to open an HTML file with GitHub pages.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>I have worked with HTML in highschool, we built simple html documents where we created headers,
   paragraphs, and a little bit of styling. I worked with CSS in my first year of Software Development,
   on a JavaFX project. I didn't work with JavaScript though, I watched some tutorials before, out of curiosity,
    learning about syntax, variable declaration, functions but never really diving into it.
</p>
<p>
   As I understood, the HTML file, is responsable to display the components in the browser, for example,
   the browser will search for the header, title, icon, default language in order to display the contents correctly.
   CSS serves for.
</p>
<p>
   The browser intteracts with web servers through protocols. The most popular and well known is the HTTP.
   It's an application layer protocol. To access a resource, the browser most probably will use a GET command.
   HTTP runs on top of TCP meaning the communication with the server and transfer of data is more secure, thanks
   to TCP's reliability.
</p>
<p>
   I can't say I learned new things necessarily about CSS, since we worked with it for a project. I learned however
   to change the CSS file directly in the browser and see how it changes dynamically the web page.
